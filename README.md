# Fake-news-Detection
This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model that can distinguish between fake and real news articles.

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset. It contains a collection of news articles labeled as either "fake" or "real," making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.
